deco2800-push-tool
==================
If your like me then you will keep forgetting to do a gradle clean build before commiting to the repo. This is a little script that prompts you to pull, merge and build before pushing.

To run the script you can download Autohotkey (http://ahkscript.org/download/ahk-install.exe) and then run 2800push.ahk or simply download and run the 2800push.exe

If anyone has any requests to make it better let me know
